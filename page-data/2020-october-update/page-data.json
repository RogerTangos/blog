Instead, we congregate over Zoom calls and emails, seeking connectedness in the harsh cold glares of our computer screens.</p>\n<p>So I‚Äôm emailing you again; to tell you about my last few months; to try to keep the interpersonal connections that I have; to try and grow the connections that I don‚Äôt have; and to connect with you in whatever way is available to me.</p>\n<p>Here‚Äôs a summary of what I‚Äôve been up to. It‚Äôs dry reading, to be sure, but I am looking for help with many of the ongoing and upcoming projects. If you‚Äôd like to be involved, please look to the end of the post. I‚Äôve listed out a few areas may be able to use your help.</p>\n<hr>\n<h1>What I‚Äôve been up to</h1>\n<p>There‚Äôs not much to do while living in the countryside of a new country weathering a pandemic. I have no social life as a result, but at least I‚Äôve found some of the past months to have been extremely productive.</p>\n<p>In short, between August 1st and October 16th, I‚Äôve started a new project for bicycle wayfinding, progressed on leaning Dutch, done too little activism, and completed stacks of administrative paperwork:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>BikePoints</li>\n<li>Learning Dutch</li>\n<li>Activism</li>\n<li>Personal tasks</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<h1>üö≤ üó∫ ‚ÜñÔ∏è BikePoints:</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://albertrcarter.com/bike-points\">BikePoints</a>, a project to create Dutch style way-finding networks in the US, has consumed roughly 38% of my effort. Over the period, a friend and I were able to program a proof-of-concept bike network and produce a blog post. Following this, I was able to submit a proposal to the City of Cambridge, Massachusetts, which city Councilor Zondervan has been helpful in supporting.</p>\n<p>The BikePoints sits on the intersection of several interests for me, including public service, transit infrastructure, data science, and environmentalism. I am doing this work entirely pro-bono in hopes that the cities of Somerville and Cambridge make use of the concept. However, I hope to eventually spin it into a stand-along business.</p>\n<h3>Next Steps for BikePoints:</h3>\n<p>I expect to set up a proper BikePoints website, work on some of the technologies behind bike points, and spend some time understanding what motivates local governments to pick up such projects like this.</p>\n<h1>üá≥üá± üìö Learning Dutch:</h1>\n<p>Dutch has consumed 29% of my recent effort, and has progressed to A1 level. Over the period, I did the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>completed a <a href=\"https://www.learndutch.org/product/dutchgrammar/\">grammar course</a></li>\n<li>continued an <a href=\"https://www.michelthomas.com/learn-dutch/\">audio course</a></li>\n<li>continued <a href=\"https://www.babbel.com/dutch-vocabulary\">learning new vocabulary</a></li>\n<li>and studied for and took a <a href=\"https://www.learndutch.org/product/dutchgrammar/\">Dutch exam</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The exam, in addition to giving me some confidence, has exposed some of my weaknesses in the language. This should help study smarter and faster going forward.</p>\n<h2>Next Steps with Learning Dutch:</h2>\n<p>In the upcoming months, I will be working on my conversational Dutch skills by reading and watching Dutch-language children‚Äôs books and TV shows, while continuing with my audio and vocabulary courses. I need a bit of a grammar break for now.</p>\n<h1>‚úä üìà Activism:</h1>\n<p>Activism has consumed 12% of my recent effort, with little to show for it. My remote location, unpredictable COVID-19 restrictions, and the language barrier have all made it extremely difficult to coordinate within Dutch-speaking groups, as was <a href=\"https://www.albertrcarter.com/june-juy-update-2020\">my previous plan</a>.</p>\n<p>As a  result, I‚Äôve written <a href=\"https://www.albertrcarter.com/leaks-for-liability-against-fossil-fuels\">a few pieces</a> and attended an established activist group‚Äôs retreat weekend , but otherwise failed to become meaningfully involved in ongoing activist projects.</p>\n<h2>Next Steps with Activism: Executive Education</h2>\n<p>In the upcoming months, I hope to write one or more pieces for the Extinction Rebellion blog, and to work with English-speaking financial activist groups in the US and UK on whatever it is they need done. I‚Äôm particularly interested in exploring actions supporting <a href=\"https://www.trucost.com/publication/universal-ownership-environmental-externalities-matter-institutional-investors-full-report/\">universal ownership</a> and divestment from <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/071415/what-are-differences-between-debt-and-equity-markets.asp\">debt markets</a>.</p>\n<h1>üóÇ ‚úâÔ∏è Personal Tasks (17% of recent effort):</h1>\n<p>Personal tasks have consumed 20% of my recent effort, including visa and unemployment paperwork (8%) and learning Emacs (3%). This has allowed me to apply for Dutch residency and submit most of my unemployment paperwork.</p>\n<p>Visa and unemployment paperwork are ever-present drags on my productivity. Documents are in Dutch and German (respectively) and procedures are in perpetual flux due to COVID-19, office closings, and travel restrictions. The resulting work is difficult to plan but easy to underestimate. I frequently have to drop everything to deal with paperwork, or face even more of it later on.</p>\n<h2>Next Steps with Personal Tasks: More Paperwork</h2>\n<p>I do not expect the bureaucratic burden to lessen. In the upcoming period, I will need to change my address to the Netherlands, transfer my insurance, and somehow procure a temporary visa while my residence permit works its way through the Dutch immigration and naturalization service. The best I can do is to try to estimate paperwork more liberally, and be better at turning in forms sooner.</p>\n<hr>\n<h1>üôè üí¨ Requests for Assistance</h1>\n<p>I would welcome help in any of the following areas.
