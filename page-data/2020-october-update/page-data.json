I have no social life as a result, but at least I‚Äôve found some of the past months to have been extremely productive.</p>\n<p>In short, between August 1st and October 16th, I‚Äôve started a new project for bicycle wayfinding, progressed on learning Dutch, done too little activism, and completed stacks of administrative paperwork:</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/b74b8a43cb94a0e56b84905fadd21c24/d67fd/pie-chart.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 111.48648648648648%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Pie chart showing recent effort.

Over the period, a friend and I were able to program a proof-of-concept bike network and produce a blog post. Following this, I was able to submit a proposal to the City of Cambridge, Massachusetts, which city Councilor Zondervan has been helpful in supporting.</p>\n<p>The BikePoints sits on the intersection of several interests for me, including public service, transit infrastructure, data science, and environmentalism. I am doing this work entirely pro-bono in hopes that the cities of Somerville and Cambridge make use of the concept. However, I hope to eventually spin it into a stand-alone business.</p>\n<h3>Next Steps for BikePoints:</h3>\n<p>I expect to set up a proper BikePoints website, work on some of the technologies behind bike points, and spend some time understanding what motivates local governments to pick up such projects like this.</p>\n<h1>üá≥üá± üìö Learning Dutch:</h1>\n<p>Dutch has consumed 29% of my recent effort, and has progressed to A1 level. Over the period, I did the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>completed a <a href=\"https://www.learndutch.org/product/dutchgrammar/\">grammar course</a></li>\n<li>continued an <a href=\"https://www.michelthomas.com/learn-dutch/\">audio course</a></li>\n<li>continued <a href=\"https://www.babbel.com/dutch-vocabulary\">learning new vocabulary</a></li>\n<li>and studied for and took a <a href=\"https://www.learndutch.org/product/dutchgrammar/\">Dutch exam</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The exam, in addition to giving me some confidence, has exposed some of my weaknesses in the language. This should help study smarter and faster going forward.</p>\n<h2>Next Steps with Learning Dutch:</h2>\n<p>In the upcoming months, I will be working on my conversational Dutch skills by reading and watching Dutch-language children‚Äôs books and TV shows, while continuing with my audio and vocabulary courses. I need a bit of a grammar break for now.</p>\n<h1>‚úä üìà Activism:</h1>\n<p>Activism has consumed 12% of my recent effort, with little to show for it. My remote location, unpredictable COVID-19 restrictions, and the language barrier have all made it extremely difficult to coordinate within Dutch-speaking groups, as was <a href=\"https://www.albertrcarter.com/june-juy-update-2020\">my previous plan</a>.</p>\n<p>As a  result, I‚Äôve written <a href=\"https://www.albertrcarter.com/leaks-for-liability-against-fossil-fuels\">a few pieces</a> and attended an established activist group‚Äôs retreat weekend , but otherwise failed to become meaningfully involved in ongoing activist projects.</p>\n<h2>Next Steps with Activism: Executive Education</h2>\n<p>In the upcoming months, I hope to write one or more pieces for the Extinction Rebellion blog, and to work with English-speaking financial activist groups in the US and UK on whatever it is they need done. I‚Äôm particularly interested in exploring actions supporting <a href=\"https://www.trucost.com/publication/universal-ownership-environmental-externalities-matter-institutional-investors-full-report/\">universal ownership</a> and divestment from <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/071415/what-are-differences-between-debt-and-equity-markets.asp\">debt markets</a>.</p>\n<h1>üóÇ ‚úâÔ∏è Personal Tasks:</h1>\n<p>Personal tasks have consumed 21% of my recent effort, including visa and unemployment paperwork (8%) and learning Emacs (3%). This has allowed me to apply for Dutch residency and submit most of my unemployment paperwork.</p>\n<p>Visa and unemployment paperwork are ever-present drags on my productivity. Documents are in Dutch and German (respectively) and procedures are in perpetual flux due to COVID-19, office closings, and travel restrictions. The resulting work is difficult to plan but easy to underestimate. I frequently have to drop everything to deal with paperwork, or face even more of it later on.</p>\n<h2>Next Steps with Personal Tasks: More Paperwork</h2>\n<p>I do not expect the bureaucratic burden to lessen. In the upcoming period, I will need to change my address to the Netherlands, transfer my insurance, and somehow procure a temporary visa while my residence permit works its way through the Dutch immigration and naturalization service. The best I can do is to try to estimate paperwork more liberally, and be better at turning in forms sooner.</p>\n<hr>\n<h1>üôè üí¨ Requests for Assistance</h1>\n<p>I would welcome help in any of the following areas.
